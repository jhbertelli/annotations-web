An open source note management app. Originally planned to be released to phones, but I postponed doing that due to personal limitations.

To run the web client, run these commands on your terminal:

```shell
cd client

npm install
npm run dev
```

or

```shell
cd client

yarn
yarn dev
```

To run the server, you need to have MongoDB installed on your machine.
If you have it, run these commands on your terminal:

```shell
cd server

npm install
npm run dev
```

or

```shell
cd server

yarn
yarn dev
```
